1. **Low-income countries:** Invest in human capital through education and healthcare to boost productivity and long-term growth. This strategy directly addresses the root causes of low GDP by improving the workforce's skills and overall well-being.

2. **Middle-income countries:** Promote technological advancement and innovation by fostering entrepreneurship and research & development. This approach helps these countries move up the value chain, enhancing productivity and competitiveness, and narrowing the GDP gap with high-income nations.

3. **High-income countries:** Implement progressive taxation policies and redistribution programs to address internal income inequalities. This ensures that the benefits of economic growth are more evenly distributed, reducing disparities within these countries and promoting social stability.

Each recommendation aims to address specific challenges faced by countries at different income levels, focusing on long-term sustainable growth and reducing GDP disparities. These strategies encourage human capital development, innovation, and equitable wealth distribution, which are crucial for global economic convergence.
